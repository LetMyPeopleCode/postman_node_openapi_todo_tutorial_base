# Postman Node.js ToDo API from OpenAPI 3 Base

This is the scaffolding code created by Postman from an OpenAPI 3.0 description for a tutorial on creating a ToDo API for [Postman Quickstarts](https://quickstarts.postman.com). 

The generated code is in the [ToDos-nodejs-express folder](./ToDos-nodejs-express/). The code is unchanged from the Postman generation in April 2023. It is for reference purposes. Further tutorials will build upon it.
